## What is this repo?

This repo is a space to showcase and document the JSON Schema Ecosystem. It is also the place we choose for now to capture and record data about the JSON Schema Ecosystem.

## Why?

JSON Schema is ubiquitous. It is used in [many places in production](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHVhS4Tj1YZOrrvl7_a9LaBAtst7BWH8a), and GitHub found it to be [the obvious choice](https://json-schema.org/blog/posts/github-case-study) (and check out our ever growing [Adopters List](https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md)). While much of JSON Schema's success can be attributed to its simplicity and ease of use, there's no doubt that the major reason for its success is the supporting ecosystem.

There are many similar solutions to JSON Schema, but these are usually language specific, which does not provide interoperability with other languages, or to a broad consuming userbase.

Beyond continuing to work on the specification itself, the JSON Schema organization has saught to inform, evangalise, support, and educate our user base and the community at large. As we think bigger, we look to make strategic decisions about how to best use our resources, creating targeted inititives to best support, sustain, and grow the already expanding and vast ecosystem of JSON Schema. It had already taken on use cases beyond that which it was originally created for many years ago. Now we have the opportunity and need to explore, observe, evaluate, and act based on the ecosystem's needs.

## How do we do that then?

Initially, we need to start tracking, logging, and visualizing some basic ecosystem statistics.

Some of these statistics may be "crude tools" with varying levels of noise, but we can look for the signal in the noise by manually investigating the causes of anything specific we think might be of interest.

While we don't yet have a [Landscape Diagram](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/issues/144), we can use some simple available metrics such as GitHub Stars to keep an eye on trends and identify projects that might be important or noteworthy within the ecosystem. Logditudinal data in this and other ares of a projects health may help us identify projects in decline or in need of additional support, which may enable us to help find a way to sustain the project, if desierable.

## How do we start?
